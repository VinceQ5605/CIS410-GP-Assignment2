              Woking together on both dot product and linear interpolation.

New Features:

1. Dot Product: calculated the dot product between ghosts and John Lemon, when he gets close enough to the ghosts, the ghosts will stop for 5 seconds. 

2. Linear Interpolation: used linear interpolation to calculate the rotation of the ghost, so now when he gets close enough to the ghosts, they will stop and rotate to the position where John Lemon located, and after 5 seconds if the ghost did see the John Lemon, they will rotate back to the original walk.

3. Particle Effect: Added particle effects around the John Lemon
